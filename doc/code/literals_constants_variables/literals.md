# Literals

## Definition

> In computer science, a **literal** is a textual representation (notation) of a value as it is written in source code. Almost all programming languages have notations for atomic values such as integers, floating-point numbers, and strings, and usually for Booleans and characters; some also have notations for elements of enumerated types and compound values such as arrays, records, and objects. An anonymous function is a literal for the function type.
>
> In contrast to literals, variables or constants are symbols that can take on one of a class of fixed values, the constant being constrained not to change. Literals are often used to initialize variables.

-- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literal_(computer_programming))

## Example

```php
<?php

$number = 15.5;
$text = "Hello, there!";

print("There is some data.");
print("\nNumber: {$number}\nText: {$text}\n");

```

**Execute**:
* [OnlinePHP](https://onlinephp.io/c/e808b)
* [OneCompiler](https://onecompiler.com/php/446d4ey5g)

In the asbove example `15.5` and `"Hello, there!"` are literals. They are used to initialize (assign a value in the creation process to) two variables. Another literal is `"There are some data."` used just to be displayed on the output.
