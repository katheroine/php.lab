# Types

## Definition

> In computer science and computer programming, a **data type** (or simply **type**) is a collection or grouping of data values, usually specified by a set of possible values, a set of allowed operations on these values, and/or a representation of these values as machine types. A data type specification in a program constrains the possible values that an expression, such as a variable or a function call, might take. On literal data, it tells the compiler or interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data. Most programming languages support basic data types of integer numbers (of varying sizes), floating-point numbers (which approximate real numbers), characters and Booleans.

Parnas, Shore & Weiss (1976) identified five definitions of a *type* that were used-sometimes implicitly-in the literature:

* ***Syntactic***:
A type is a purely syntactic label associated with a variable when it is declared. Although useful for advanced type systems such as substructural type systems, such definitions provide no intuitive meaning of the types.

* ***Representation***:
A type is defined in terms of a composition of more primitive types—often machine types.

* ***Representation and behaviour***:
A type is defined as its representation and a set of operators manipulating these representations.

* ***Value space***:
A type is a set of possible values which a variable can possess. Such definitions make it possible to speak about (disjoint) unions or Cartesian products of types.

* ***Value space and behaviour***:
A type is a set of values which a variable can possess and a set of functions that one can apply to these values.

The definition in terms of a representation was often done in imperative languages such as ALGOL and Pascal, while the definition in terms of a value space and behaviour was used in higher-level languages such as Simula and CLU. Types including behavior align more closely with object-oriented models, whereas a structured programming model would tend to not include code, and are called plain old data structures.
